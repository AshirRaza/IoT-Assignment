# IoT-Assignment
This project implements an IoT system on the Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V3 board that evaluates the performance of adaptive signal sampling using local FFT analysis, compared to traditional fixed oversampling. The system periodically transmits the computed average of the signal via MQTT over WiFi.
